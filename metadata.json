  "description": "Dock for GNOME Shell 40+. Does use native GNOME Shell Dash. Very light extension.\n\n Hover the bottom of your screen and GNOME Shell dash will appear without overview and will hide when you leave the dash. Native GNOME Shell click behavior is modified: minimize if one window is open, overview if many windows are open. Scroll on the dock to change workspace.\n\n There are some variables you can easily set in extension.js code (opacity, timeouts...). There will be no preferences UI.\n\n Please report bugs through GitHub.",
